I really love Pixabay images. so I wanted to have an easy way to use these images in Moodle.

_How to Install_
* Download as zip or via Git.
* Extract in your [moodle_root]/repository
* Rename the extracted directory to : pixabay
* Get you API key from pixabay at https://pixabay.com/api/docs/ (You have to create there an account)
* Go to your Moodle notification page and install the plugin.
* Go to your moodle admin -> plugin -> repositories - and enable this repository.
* Get into this repository settings and insert your API key (won't work without key!)
* Now the repository should be in your file picker.
* Enjoy!

_Thanks_
